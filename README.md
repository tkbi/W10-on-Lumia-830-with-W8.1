# W10 on Lumia 830 from W8.1 works
Upgrade Windows Phone W8.1 with W10 1709

As a First comment, I only show a way, how to upgrade a Windows phone Nokia Lumia 830 to W10, you do it by your self and on your on risk, don't claim on, if it's go wrong.

You have to know, if not already done, Windows Phone 10 is dead.
There aren't any further support from Microsoft, all server are switched off, there is only some older Apps on the Store and no-buddy will create new apps any more.
That's a shame, yes. But that's the trues. We have to thing twice, before we buy some Microsoft hardware staff. Because the Nokia Lumia is not the once, the same problem we have with Surface RT.

Ok, so far so good, to know the histories is important as well :-)

Let's try.

After my own experience it is the best way, to make a backup of your data from your phone, so everything is save in one-drive, for later restore of your user data.
So we don't have to organized the phone again.

You have to notice here, that you can every time go back to W8.1 with using WPinternals, with your own stack-ROM as ZIP-file (generated in WPinternals), that is the best way to start with upgrade to W10, or if it's available (no-buddy know it) you can download it with WPinternals, please use this manual at the website:

https://www.xda-developers.com/windows-phone-internals-opens-the-custom-rom-world-for-lumia-phones/

Therefore you have to download the WPinternals 2.8 first at :

https://windows-phone-internals.en.lo4d.com/windows

That is the latest release. For further information please visit the website:

https://www.wpinternals.net

Hopefully this side is available for a long time, otherwise we have to find a way to get WPinternals to life again.

After download and installation, we have this pretty useful tool, thanks a lot to Rene' how is the producer of WPinternals, Daniel who re-managed the website again, and Gus who did help him.

As next, the step's we have to go:

0.) Yes important: Take out the sim card and the SD-Card from your phone before you go further here!

1.) Generate or download your stack-rom with WPinternals. Or you have it already.

2.) Flash it on your Phone with WPinternals. So you have a clear structure to start with.

3.) Download the new Custom-ROM (WP10 1709) from this website:
     http://www.mediafire.com/file/f8c8pip48qoh92k/Lumia830_RM984_SamsungEMMC_FCU_15254.158.zip/file

4.) Start WPinternals again and flash this Custom-ROM with the function "Flash Custom ROM" to your phone.

5.) Reboot your phone again, with push volume-down and power buttons for 10 second or little more, as you get feedback with vibration at your phone.

That's is all, enjoy with your Nokia Lumia 830 and W10.
Take in your SIM card and SD-Card again. And power on your phone.

By my self, I got a problem, because my phone stuck with the Windows logo, and don't boot further. But I got it to run. To do it:

Be sure your battery is charged !

Take out the battery, then put it in your phone again.
Press the power button and release it again when the phone vibrates  (after 1-2 seconds) and press and hold the Volume-down key until you see an exclamation sign on screen.

Now press the buttons in order separately : Volume-UP, Volume-Down, Power-button, Volume-Down.

Wait for a couple of minutes to finish the process. You should see some gears moving.
For maybe 5-10 minutes or more. 

After reboot you can enjoy your phone again, with a big smile :-)
