After Upgrade to W10M from W8.1M I did gotten a problem with the Windows store.
The phone stuck in update the store.
If you have the same problem, and have in your settings, set, that the SD-Card do storeage all your new Apps, and everything's else, then followed procedure will help.

Connect your phone to your PC, then you see your phone as a separate folder.
Double-click or allow to open and search for the subfolder : “WUDownloadCache”

Delete the files / folder inside this folder “WUDownloadCache”, but not the folder them self.

Then open at your phone the store again, and push “update”, after a short while, there should
then downloading start, and at the end, Windows store is working again :-)
